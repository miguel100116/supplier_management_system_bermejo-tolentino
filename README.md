## 1. Overview

The **Supplier Management System** is an internal web application built for **mgenesis** to evaluate, rank, and monitor the company's external business partners — its couriers, inventory suppliers, and on-site subcontractors.

At its heart, the system replaces scattered paper evaluation forms and standalone Microsoft Forms surveys with a single, unified platform where employees can:

- **Fill out structured evaluation surveys** for partner companies,
- **See those results turned into live analytics, rankings, and report cards** the moment they are submitted, and
- **Track each partner's compliance documents** (permits, certifications, insurance, etc.) and their expiry dates.

It is a role-aware platform: what each employee sees — which modules, which data — is computed automatically from their organizational rank and department, and can be fine-tuned by an administrator.

> **Status note:** This system is in **active pre-production development**. Staging uses Supabase email/password authentication and shared persistence for profiles, permissions, surveys, Partner Companies, evaluation responses, archives, category labels, Feedback Hub records, and document-notification settings. Device-specific drafts and display preferences remain local. Microsoft login and Graph email remain unavailable without Azure access.

## 2. What the System Does

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **Partner evaluation surveys** | Create, publish, and fill structured feedback forms scoped to specific departments, ranks, and companies. |
| **Real-time analytics** | Every submission instantly refreshes company-wide charts, trends, and comparisons. |
| **Scoring & ranking** | Weighted, rubric-based scoring converts raw answers into a normalized 0–100 composite score and a ranked leaderboard per partner type. |
| **Compliance document tracking** | A categorized register of every partner's compliance documents, with configurable expiry milestones and "expiring soon / expired" alerts. |
| **Report generation** | Summary, per-company, per-question, and executive-summary report builders, exportable to PDF, Excel, and CSV. |
| **Partner feedback delivery** | Send finished report cards to partner companies by email (individually or in bulk) via Microsoft Graph. |
| **Presentation mode** | Build a staggered slide deck from the current analytics for leadership presentations (exportable to PDF/PPTX). |
| **Archiving** | Archive completed survey periods into named series so multi-year trends accumulate without cluttering the active view. |
| **Account & access management** | Admins manage employee accounts, per-department access ceilings, and per-account permission overrides. |
| **Bulk imports** | Import a partner-company master list, or bulk-import external evaluation responses, from Excel/CSV. |

---

## 3. Core Concepts & Organization Technique

The system's data model is organized along a few consistent axes. Understanding these four is enough to understand the whole application.

### 3.1 Survey Data Types

All survey data is divided into **three partner types**. Every survey, response, partner company, score, and report belongs to exactly one of these:

| Type | Label | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Courier** | Courier Satisfaction | Courier and logistics satisfaction reporting |
| **Supplier** | Supplier Quality | Inventory supplier assessment and commercials |
| **Subcontractor** | Subcontractor Performance | On-site subcontractor compliance and execution |

### 3.2 Categories, Weights & Scoring

Each survey type's questions are grouped into **5 scored categories** plus a fixed 6th "Overall" bucket for free-form/period feedback that isn't scored.

| Survey Type | The 5 scoring categories |
|---|---|
| **Courier** | Delivery, Commercial, Technology, Support, Security |
| **Supplier** | Documentation, Delivery, Price, Quality, Communication |
| **Subcontractor** | Delivery, Documentation, Cost, Quality, Communication |

- **Weighted rubric:** Each question carries a point value validated against the company's original paper evaluation forms (`src/data/questionWeights.ts`). Answers are scored, summed per category, and normalized so **every survey type shares one 0–100 composite axis** (`src/utils/scoring.ts`).
- **Score bands:** Composite scores map to labeled bands (e.g. Critical → Excellent). Companies with no scoreable answers yet get a distinct "No Score Yet" band instead of being mislabeled as failing.
- **Ranking:** The leaderboard uses a *volume-weighted* variant of the composite score, pulling companies with very few evaluations toward the peer mean so a single glowing review doesn't top the chart.
- **Renaming vs. rubric:** Admins can **rename** a category's display label via the **Categories Manager** without ever touching the underlying point values — display names are translated by slot position, keeping the validated rubric intact.

### 3.3 Roles, Designations & Departments (RBAC)

Access is **computed**, not hand-assigned per user. Every account has three attributes, and its default access falls out of their combination (`src/utils/rbac.ts`):

- **System Role:** `Admin` (unrestricted) or `Employee`.
- **Designation (rank):** Rank & File, Supervisory, Managerial, Director, or Executive.
- **Department:** Accounts Payable – Trade, Business Solutions Manager, Executive Office, Logistics, Procurement Group, or TASS.

**Default module access by designation:**

| Designation | Default modules granted |
|---|---|
| Rank & File | Dashboard, Analytics, Survey Forms, Partner Companies, Document Tracker, Notifications |
| Supervisory | All Rank & File modules + Feedback Hub and Reports |
| Managerial | All Supervisory modules + Survey Explorer, Present, and Archive Center |
| Director | Same default set as Managerial |
| Executive | Dashboard, Analytics, Reports, Present, Notifications (a reduced, summary-focused set) |
| **Admin (role)** | **Every module**, including Account Management, Renew Compliance Documents, and Import Evaluation Responses |

An Admin can **override** access per individual account ("Custom Overrides"), or set a bulk access **ceiling** for an entire department ("Department Access"), from the Account Management page.

### 3.4 Data Scoping & Isolation

Beyond *which modules* a user sees, the system controls *which response data* they see (`applyAccessFilter` in `src/App.tsx`):

| Who | Sees which survey responses |
|---|---|
| Admin / Executive / Director | Every response (within their permitted survey types) |
| Supervisory | Only their own department's responses |
| Rank & File | Only their own submissions |
| **Analytics (everyone)** | **Always company-wide and aggregate-only**, regardless of rank |

A **Data Scope** toggle (shared across Dashboard and Analytics) further switches between *Current* (active period), *All-Time* (active + all archived periods), and *Custom* (specific archived series).

---

## 4. Modules

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | Personalized performance indicators and KPIs. |
| **Survey Forms** | View, fill, and publish feedback forms. |
| **Survey Explorer** | Analyze complete raw survey response records. |
| **Analytics** | Company-wide statistical charts, trends, and company comparisons. |
| **Reports** | Summary / Company / Question / Executive-Summary builders + raw exports (PDF, Excel, CSV). |
| **Present** | Staggered slide-deck presentation builder (PDF/PPTX export). |
| **Partner Companies** | Manage external courier, supplier, and subcontractor rosters, branches, and documents. |
| **Document Tracker** | Categorized compliance-document register across all partner companies. |
| **Renew Compliance Documents** | Action permission: update document expiry/status without full Account Management access. |
| **Supplier Ranking** | Curate and reorder the Top 20 suppliers evaluable by default in Supplier surveys. |
| **Partners Feedback Hub** | Send report cards to partner companies (single or bulk email via Microsoft Graph). |
| **Account Management** | Configure roles, ranks, departments, and per-user/per-department permissions. |
| **Notifications** | Audit trail of incoming survey responses and document-expiry alerts, opened as a modal from the header bell rather than a separate sidebar destination. |
| **Archive Center** | Browse and restore archived feedback submissions and series. |
| **Import Evaluation Responses** | Bulk-import external evaluation data (Excel/CSV) into the system. |
| **Categories Manager** | Rename the display labels of scoring categories per survey type. |
| **Settings / Profile** | A large modal opened from the account-session dropdown. Employees retain their full profile, impact, recent-submission, preference, and session view; Admins retain the complete Settings view with activity, import, and cache-management tools. |

---

## 5. Architecture & Tech Stack

The application is a **single-page React app** with a thin Express server used only for local dev/preview and production static hosting.

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **UI framework** | React 18 + TypeScript |
| **Build tool** | Vite 6 |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS 3 |
| **Charts** | Recharts |
| **Icons / animation** | lucide-react, motion |
| **Server** | Express (dev middleware via Vite; static host in production) |
| **Auth** | Supabase email/password in staging; optional Microsoft Entra ID code remains unavailable without Azure configuration |
| **Backend** | Supabase normalized import/audit tables plus an RLS-protected editable application store in staging |
| **Email** | Microsoft Graph (`Mail.Send`, delegated) |
| **Exports** | jsPDF + jspdf-autotable (PDF), xlsx (Excel), papaparse (CSV), pptxgenjs (PPTX), docx |

**Key design decision — the data source seam:** Authenticated staging sessions load the shared Partner Company registry, evaluation responses, surveys, archives, and configuration through the Supabase application repository used by `useSurveyData.ts`. The normalized CSV tables remain the immutable import/audit layer, while `application_records` is the editable UI-facing store. Local storage is limited to authenticated startup caching and device-specific state; the frontend no longer generates or bundles mock business records.

## 7. Data Storage & Persistence

**Current state:** Authenticated staging users load and save profiles, department permissions, surveys, Partner Companies/documents, evaluation responses, archives, category labels, Feedback Hub contacts/queue/settings, and document-notification rules through Supabase. `localStorage` is retained as an authenticated startup cache and for intentionally device-specific state such as in-progress survey drafts and layout preferences.

> **Implication:** Authenticated shared business data is available across devices through staging Supabase. Clearing browser storage removes only the local cache and device-specific drafts/preferences; it does not delete the shared backend records.

**Staging backend:** The normalized migrations under [`supabase/migrations`](supabase/migrations) are applied to the dedicated staging project. Imported normalized tables remain the immutable source/audit layer. `app_profiles` and per-entity `application_records` are the editable frontend store. RLS scopes evaluation rows by profile and permits employees to insert only their own submissions; shared configuration and registry writes are Admin-only. The older [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql) remains an unapplied draft.

---

## 8. Authentication

Staging signs users in with **Supabase email and password** because the team does not have access to the Microsoft Entra tenant. Only `@mgenesis.com` addresses are accepted, and email confirmation is enabled in the staging Supabase project.

- **Email domain is enforced:** only `@mgenesis.com` addresses are accepted.
- **Password management:** staging passwords belong to Supabase Auth. A reset UI is still pending.
- **Session safety:** users can sign out manually; after 25 minutes without activity the app shows a five-minute warning, then signs out at 30 minutes. Activity in another open tab refreshes the same account-specific deadline.
- **Microsoft features:** Microsoft login and Graph report-email delivery remain unavailable until Azure access is provided.

> **Security boundary:** browser access uses the publishable key plus authenticated RLS. Secret/service-role keys must never be placed in `VITE_*` variables.

**Bootstrap admins:** The approved bootstrap identities are maintained in `src/App.tsx` and `supabase/seed_admins.sql` so a fresh deployment can authorize the initial administrators. Admin rights are authorization records; set an approved employee's System Role to `Admin` to grant them.

---

## 9. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- A modern browser

### Install & run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app starts on **http://localhost:3000**. With Supabase variables configured, the login page uses email/password authentication and loads the staging Partner Companies registry after sign-in.

Create a staging account with an `@mgenesis.com` email, confirm it from the received email, then sign in. There is no quick-login or frontend-only authentication path.

---

## 10. Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure at least one real authentication provider:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Supabase project connection (publishable key is not a secret; access control lives in RLS). |
| `VITE_AZURE_CLIENT_ID` / `VITE_AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Microsoft Entra ID app registration — required for Microsoft sign-in and Graph email. |
| `VITE_AZURE_REDIRECT_URI` | Optional; defaults to `window.location.origin`. |

Full step-by-step Azure app-registration instructions are documented inline in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

---

## 11. Available Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the app in development on http://localhost:3000 (Vite middleware via Express). |
| `npm run build` | Type-check-free production build: Vite bundles the client, esbuild bundles the server to `dist/server.cjs`. |
| `npm run start` | Run the built production server (`node dist/server.cjs`). |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the built client with Vite. |
| `npm run lint` | Type-check the project (`tsc --noEmit`). |

---

## 12. Deployment

The production build produces a static client plus a small Express server that serves it and provides an `/api/health` health check.

```bash
npm run build
NODE_ENV=production npm run start
```

The app has previously been deployed to **Vercel**. Before deploying to the real company environment:

1. Configure the approved Supabase URL and publishable key; never put a secret/service-role key in a `VITE_*` variable.
2. Decide whether audit/export history must be shared across devices; it remains local because it is currently lightweight client-side telemetry.
3. Configure Azure only if Microsoft login or Graph email is restored as a requirement.

---

## 13. The Creation Process (Development History)

The system was built iteratively over roughly three weeks, starting **July 18, 2026**. It began as a Microsoft Forms analytics dashboard prototype and grew into a full partner-management platform. Milestones, summarized from git history:

| Date | Milestone | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-18 | Initial commit | First working version; Notification Logs for employees. |
| 2026-07-20 | Settings & evaluation picker | Reworked settings modal; company evaluation picker. |
| 2026-07-21 | Notification fixes | Employee notification-log behavior fixes. |
| 2026-07-22 | Bulk sending | "Send To Companies" and Bulk Sending introduced. |
| 2026-07-23 | Masterlist & stability | Partner master list; simulated system clock; scaling & Excel-export fixes. |
| 2026-07-24 | Deployment fix | Vercel deployment fix. |
| 2026-07-26 – 27 | Rating & imports | Improved rating system; CSV import; masterlist updates. |
| 2026-07-27 – 29 | Document tracking | Document master-list refinements for compliance tracking. |
| 2026-07-30 | Analytics cleanup | Analytics reworked for the revised rating system; UI decluttering. |
| 2026-07-31 | Dashboards | Documents Tracker + Employee Evaluation Tracker dashboards. |
| 2026-08-03 | Updates | Final committed round before handoff. |
| 2026-08-04 | Backend groundwork | Supabase draft schema + partial wiring; `.env` / demo-mode flags added. |
| 2026-08-05 | Categories & docs | Categories Manager wired up; system turnover + Admin/Employee manuals added. |

The system now uses explicit Supabase repository and adapter boundaries for shared business data, keeping normalized import/audit tables separate from the editable frontend projection.

---

## 14. User Manuals

Full, standalone user documentation lives in the [`docs/`](docs) folder as Word documents:

- **[`docs/Admin_Manual.docx`](docs/Admin_Manual.docx)** — the complete administrator guide (account management, surveys, reports, compliance, imports, settings).
- **[`docs/Employee_Manual.docx`](docs/Employee_Manual.docx)** — the complete employee guide (filling evaluations, submissions, notifications, profile).

Both manuals are generated from source via the scripts in [`docs/_build/`](docs/_build) (`build-admin.cjs` / `build-employee.cjs`), so they can be regenerated if content changes.

For a condensed reference (roles matrix, workflow diagrams, FAQ), see [`SYSTEM_TURNOVER.md`](SYSTEM_TURNOVER.md).

---

## 15. Current Status & Known Issues

This system is **pre-production**. The most important open items (verified against source; see [`SYSTEM_TURNOVER.md`](SYSTEM_TURNOVER.md) §2.4 for the full list and workarounds):

| # | Issue | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Supabase email/password is active in staging, but password-reset UI is not implemented. | Use the Supabase dashboard for staging recovery until a reset flow is added. |
| 2 | Core business modules and Feedback Hub configuration are Supabase-backed, but audit/export logs remain local. | Migrate those logs only if cross-device auditing becomes an approved requirement. |
| 3 | The first confirmed account defaults to Employee unless it uses the bootstrap `admin@mgenesis.com` identity. | Promote an approved user in `app_profiles` from the Supabase dashboard before testing Admin edits. |
| 4 | The old draft `supabase/schema.sql` contains temporary anonymous policies and is not the applied staging schema. | Use versioned migrations only; never apply the draft file as-is. |
| 5 | Microsoft login and Graph email are unavailable without Azure access. | Keep them disabled or obtain an approved Entra app registration later. |
| 6 | `EFAS_Project_Charter.docx` in the project root is a corrupted Word file. | Restore from backup or re-document the charter separately. |

---

## 16. Glossary
