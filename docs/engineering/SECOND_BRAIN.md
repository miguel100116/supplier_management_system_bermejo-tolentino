# Supplier Management System — Engineering Second Brain

Last verified: 2026-09-21

This document preserves durable engineering context for maintainers and coding agents. It is a map, not a substitute for reading the relevant code. Verify details before making consequential changes.

## Product intent

The Supplier Management System is an internal application for evaluating and managing Couriers, Suppliers, and Subcontractors. It covers surveys, analytics, rankings, compliance documents, imports, report generation, feedback delivery, account access, and archiving.

Canonical product documentation:

- `README.md` — product scope, architecture, modules, setup, and known issues.
- `SYSTEM_TURNOVER.md` — operational handoff and current implementation status.
- `docs/Admin_Manual.docx` and `docs/Employee_Manual.docx` — role-specific user manuals.

## Verified system map

### Runtime

- React 18 and TypeScript frontend built with Vite 6.
- Tailwind CSS for styling and Recharts for analytics visuals.
- Thin Express host in `server.ts` for Vite development middleware, runtime public configuration, health checks, and production static serving.
- `server/index.js` is a second, overlapping server implementation and should be treated as legacy until its consumers are verified.
- Main commands are declared in `package.json`: `dev`, `build`, `start`, `preview`, and `lint`.

### External boundaries

- Supabase email/password authentication is active for staging. Microsoft Entra ID code remains present but is unavailable without Azure tenant access.
- Microsoft Graph delegated email sending.
- Supabase client, canonical application repository, SQL migrations, seed administration, Realtime invalidation, and row-level-security policies.
- Supabase CLI local configuration is initialized in `supabase/config.toml` and linked to the dedicated `supplier-management-staging` project (`adxwaxhnqxpmgjvsxgug`). The additive normalized migration and reviewed data import were applied there on 2026-09-16. Remote lint passed; repeat import and reconciliation preserved the expected counts with zero duplicates and zero broken relationships. A 2026-09-18 read-only audit confirmed that all four repository CSV hashes, normalized counts, imported company identities, and imported response values match staging and its UI-facing application records; 86 later non-CSV response rows remain preserved. On 2026-09-21 the shared-state and consolidated-RLS migrations were applied without changing imported row counts; `application_records` and `app_profiles` are now in the Realtime publication. Production remains untouched.
- CSV/XLSX imports and PDF, PPTX, Word, CSV, and spreadsheet exports.

### Current persistence model

- Authenticated staging users load and save profiles, permissions, surveys, Partner Companies/documents, responses, archives, category labels, Feedback Hub data, notification/reminder configuration, compliance snapshots, ranking/activity/modification/export history, and employee notification state through Supabase.
- Imported normalized tables remain the immutable source/audit layer. `app_profiles` and per-entity `application_records` are the canonical editable frontend store.
- Analytics provenance is explicit as of 2026-09-22: client CSV rows use `dataSource=client_csv`, approved live form submissions use `production_submission`, and staging form submissions use `test_submission`. Official Analytics includes only the first two. Legacy normalized/default-form and UI-import IDs are recognized as client data; legacy pre-production `RESP-*` rows remain stored but are classified as test data. `VITE_DEPLOYMENT_ENV` defaults to staging and must be set to production only for the approved live deployment.
- Browser `localStorage` remains an authenticated startup cache and stores intentionally device-specific drafts/preferences. Eligible historical browser records are uploaded once when the remote set is empty; remote empty sets are authoritative after migration.
- Supabase Realtime events invalidate the relevant client store and cause an RLS-protected refetch; event payloads are not trusted as application data.

### Authorization

- UI access is derived from role, designation, department, and overrides.
- Supabase password identity and session restoration are integrated in the frontend; localStorage is not trusted as identity when Supabase is configured.
- The applied database schema enables RLS. Shared reference records are readable by confirmed `@mgenesis.com` users; configuration/registry writes are role-restricted; users may insert only their own evaluations and permitted operational records; response reads are scoped by role, department, or ownership. Security-definer authorization helpers live in the unexposed `private` schema, and policy checks are consolidated to one policy per operation.
- `supabase/schema.sql` currently contains clearly labeled temporary anonymous response policies. They are a production blocker if enabled.

## Current repository health

Verified on 2026-09-21:

- `npm run lint` succeeds and runs TypeScript checks for both application and import scripts; ESLint is not configured.
- `npm test` covers focused domain, persistence-contract, import, mapping, and authorization helpers; broader component, integration, and end-to-end coverage is not yet established. Use the current command output as the source for the exact test count.
- No repository CI workflow is present.
- The TypeScript source under `src/` is roughly 65,000 lines across about 100 files.
- Major concentration points include `src/hooks/useSurveyData.ts`, `src/App.tsx`, several page components above 1,000 lines, and a very large generated/static partner seed file.
- `.vite/` cache files are tracked despite being generated artifacts.
- Root-level extraction scripts, generated text, screenshots, forms, and data exports make source ownership and release contents less clear.
- The working tree contained pre-existing uncommitted application and configuration changes when these agent rules were added. Every task must refresh `git status` and preserve unrelated work.

## Architectural pressure points

1. **Migration completion** — production still requires an explicitly authorized migration/deployment and post-cutover reconciliation; staging alone is not production proof.
2. **Large orchestration units** — central hooks and pages mix state, business rules, persistence, and presentation, increasing regression risk.
3. **Business-rule duplication** — scoring, RBAC, filtering, reporting, and status rules need canonical domain modules.
4. **Boundary validation** — CSV/XLSX, browser storage, auth claims, Supabase rows, and API responses require runtime validation.
5. **Delivery confidence** — missing automated tests and CI leave type checking and manual testing as the primary gates.
6. **Repository hygiene** — generated artifacts, large data files, and duplicate server entry points obscure the deployable product.

## Target direction

These are engineering guidelines, not a completed design decision:

- Move incrementally toward feature-oriented modules under `src/features/`.
- Keep pure domain rules independent of React and infrastructure.
- Put external systems and browser APIs behind typed adapters.
- Keep Supabase as the single durable source for shared data and restrict browser persistence to cache/device-only state.
- Establish a test pyramid using a TypeScript-compatible unit/component runner plus a small end-to-end suite.
- Establish pull-request CI with clean install, type check, lint, tests, production build, and security checks.
- Remove generated caches and sensitive/business exports from source control, with curated anonymized fixtures where tests require data.

## Modernization sequence

Use small vertical slices; preserve working behavior throughout.

1. Establish baseline tests around scoring, RBAC, imports, compliance dates, and the most critical user journeys.
2. Add reproducible quality scripts and pull-request CI.
3. Define typed repository interfaces around current persistence and external services.
4. Extract pure domain logic from `useSurveyData`, `App.tsx`, and large pages behind characterization tests.
5. Move one feature at a time into feature modules, keeping public APIs small.
6. Migrate to one backend source of truth with tested data migration and rollback.
7. Harden RLS, remove temporary anonymous access, and validate authorization at the data boundary.
8. Consolidate the server entry point and clean generated or obsolete repository artifacts.

This order may change when product risk or user priorities justify it. Record an approved change below.

## Decision log

Use short entries with this shape:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD — Decision title
Status: proposed | accepted | superseded
Context: why a decision was needed
Decision: the chosen direction
Consequences: tradeoffs and follow-up work
Evidence: links to code, issue, PR, or ADR
```

### 2026-09-10 — Repository-wide agent operating agreement

Status: accepted

Context: The project needs consistent agent behavior for safe refactoring, modular design, testing, CI/CD, security, and durable context retention.

Decision: Use the root `AGENTS.md` as the authoritative repository rule set and this document as maintained project memory.

Consequences: Agents must follow the engineering loop, preserve unrelated work, verify changes proportionately, and keep this document current when durable project facts change.

Evidence: `AGENTS.md`

### 2026-09-10 — Preserve the existing UI during modular refactoring

Status: accepted

Context: Modularization is intended to improve internal maintainability without changing the established user experience.

Decision: Refactoring tasks must preserve the rendered UI and interaction behavior. Any redesign or visible change requires separate, explicit user authorization and visual verification.

Consequences: Agents should baseline relevant desktop and mobile states before UI-adjacent refactors, retain existing markup and styling where practical, and report the visual comparison performed.

Evidence: `AGENTS.md`, section "Refactoring rules"

### 2026-09-11 - Canonical Feedback Hub company-report boundary

Status: accepted

Context: Feedback Hub PDF generation previously selected companies by display name and assembled report data in multiple UI paths, which could mix companies or survey templates.

Decision: Use `src/features/feedback-hub/reporting/` as the typed source for survey-template mapping, company-ID resolution, response scoping, category metrics, rating bands, and report DTO construction. New response and queued-report records retain both survey and company IDs; ambiguous legacy name-only rows must stop report generation.

Consequences: Preview, print, queue, revision, and bulk generation share one report-data contract. The Word files remain visual references only; generated PDFs use current application data. Any future template or scoring change should update this module and its focused tests.

Evidence: `src/features/feedback-hub/reporting/`, `src/utils/companyReportExport.ts`, `src/features/feedback-hub/reporting/companyReportData.test.ts`

### 2026-09-15 - Additive normalized CSV import boundary

Status: accepted for local preparation; not applied to Supabase

Context: The four production CSV files and the accessible live PostgREST schema do not fit the legacy one-table response mirror or the stale draft schema without losing Master List document fields and canonical question relationships.

Decision: Keep the live `suppliers` and `survey_responses` tables untouched. Prepare additive normalized company, branch, document, form, question, submission, and answer tables in `supabase/migrations/202609150001_normalized_business_data.sql`. Import through deterministic IDs and UPSERTs, with a mandatory dry run and human-reviewed resolutions for unresolved company names. A reviewed resolution may target an existing Master List BP Code or preserve a genuinely distinct evaluation-only company without inventing a BP Code.

Consequences: The import is repeatable and preserves raw source values alongside parsed fields. The reviewed local resolution file is ignored by Git and produces a zero-blocker dry run. The normalized schema is present only in the dedicated staging project; no production database or UI source-of-truth change occurs until staging import and reconciliation are completed and followed by authenticated RLS policies and application service cutover.

Evidence: `scripts/supabase-import/`, `supabase/verification/normalized_import_checks.sql`, `docs/engineering/SUPABASE_NORMALIZED_IMPORT.md`

### 2026-09-16 - Supabase password-auth staging connection

Status: accepted for staging

Context: The team cannot access the Microsoft Azure tenant, so Entra authentication cannot be completed. The application also contained a local environment configuration that pointed to production and placed a service-role credential in a browser-facing variable.

Decision: Use Supabase email/password authentication for staging, restricted to `@mgenesis.com`. Point the local browser build to the dedicated staging project through an ignored `.env.local` containing only the staging publishable key. Grant authenticated read-only RLS access to normalized company/form reference tables and load Partner Companies through a typed adapter. Keep raw evaluators, submissions, answers, and all backend write paths locked pending role and write-policy design.

Consequences: Staging login and Partner Company reads no longer depend on Azure. The former demo login was removed on 2026-09-18. Shared feature state now persists through the staging application repository, while Microsoft Graph mail remains unavailable without Azure configuration. The production service-role credential found in `.env` must be rotated; it is not present in the generated staging build.

Evidence: `src/services/supabasePasswordAuth.ts`, `src/services/normalizedPartnerCompanies.ts`, `supabase/migrations/202609160001_staging_email_auth_read_access.sql`

### 2026-09-16 - Canonical editable application records in staging

Status: accepted for staging

Context: Partner edits, evaluation submissions, surveys, profiles, permissions, archives, and category changes were still browser-local after the initial read-only connection.

Decision: Keep normalized import tables immutable and seed a per-entity `application_records` store for the frontend contract. Store account authorization in `app_profiles`. Use Supabase as the authenticated source of truth with local storage only as an authenticated cache. Enforce profile-scoped response reads, own-submission inserts, and Admin-only shared registry/configuration writes through RLS.

Consequences: The main shared business modules, Feedback Hub records, and document-notification rules now persist across devices in staging. Device drafts/preferences and lightweight audit/export logs remain local. A confirmed user must exist before authenticated writes can be tested, and an approved profile must be promoted to Admin before shared registry/configuration edits can succeed.

Evidence: `src/services/applicationRepository.ts`, `src/hooks/useSurveyData.ts`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/utils/feedbackHubStore.ts`, `src/utils/documentNotificationSettings.ts`, `supabase/migrations/202609160002_application_persistence.sql`, `supabase/migrations/202609160003_secondary_shared_modules.sql`, `supabase/verification/application_persistence_checks.sql`

### 2026-09-17 - Canonical Document Tracker labels at the application boundary

Status: accepted for staging

Context: The normalized import intentionally stores stable source keys such as `local.business_permit`, while Document Tracker reads human-readable labels such as `Business Permit`. The editable application seed copied source keys verbatim, so populated database documents rendered as missing without producing an error. Local and Foreign source blocks also share labels such as `AFS` and must be resolved by branch category.

Decision: Keep stable dotted keys in the immutable normalized tables. Map them to Document Tracker labels in `normalizedPartnerCompanies.ts`, select only the category-applicable Local or Foreign block, and store canonical labels in editable `partner_company` application records. The staging migrations preserve later canonical edits and correct only values proven to match the non-applicable source block.

Consequences: Authenticated Document Tracker views now resolve imported document values and expiry dates. Future normalized adapters must use the same mapping boundary; new source document keys require a mapping entry and a regression test.

Evidence: `src/services/normalizedPartnerCompanies.ts`, `src/services/normalizedPartnerCompanies.test.ts`, `supabase/migrations/202609170001_document_tracker_key_mapping.sql`, `supabase/migrations/202609170002_document_tracker_category_collision_fix.sql`

### 2026-09-17 - Per-user notification read state

Status: accepted; applied to staging on 2026-09-18

Context: Admin notification read/unread choices existed only in React memory. Logging out and back in regenerated document alerts and marked them unread again, so the badge returned even after "Mark all as read."

Decision: Persist a bounded, timestamped set of read notification IDs per authenticated user as an owner-scoped `notification_read_state` application record. Retain the same record in local storage as an authenticated cache, choose the newest valid copy during login, and serialize remote writes so rapid read/unread actions cannot arrive out of order.

Consequences: Read state survives same-browser sessions and synchronizes across authenticated staging devices. Notification content remains derived from response and document records; no notifications are duplicated into the state record. The linked migration history confirmed `202609170003` locally and remotely after the push.

Evidence: `src/utils/notificationReadState.ts`, `src/services/applicationRepository.ts`, `src/hooks/useSurveyData.ts`, `supabase/migrations/202609170003_notification_read_state.sql`

### 2026-09-18 - Inactivity-based session logout

Status: accepted

Context: Manual logout correctly cleared the local identity and signed out Supabase and Microsoft sessions, but an unattended authenticated browser remained usable until the provider session ended.

Decision: Apply an account-specific 30-minute inactivity limit in the application, show a five-minute accessible warning, and synchronize activity timestamps across browser tabs. Reuse the existing provider logout path when the limit expires; do not store tokens or credentials in the idle-session state.

Consequences: Authenticated sessions now close after inactivity, while active work in any open tab refreshes the deadline. Supabase token expiry and database RLS remain the authoritative authentication and authorization boundaries.

Evidence: `src/hooks/useIdleSessionTimeout.ts`, `src/utils/sessionTimeout.ts`, `src/utils/sessionTimeout.test.ts`, `src/App.tsx`

### 2026-09-18 - Remove frontend mock business data

Status: accepted

Context: The frontend still contained quick-login identities, a placeholder employee roster, a bundled Partner Company snapshot, generated evaluation responses, simulated time, sample Feedback Hub contacts, and email paths that could display a successful send without calling Microsoft Graph.

Decision: Remove the demo authentication and Database Simulator paths, generated response and bundled company datasets, simulated clock, placeholder data service, and sample Feedback Hub contacts. Keep the real survey templates and authenticated local cache. Require a real authentication provider, hydrate shared business records from Supabase, and never mark an email sent unless Microsoft Graph reports success.

Consequences: A new browser no longer invents companies, accounts, evaluations, contacts, dates, or delivery results. Without configured authentication the app remains at the login screen. Clearing the local cache rehydrates shared records after the next authenticated load; CSV import/audit tables and staging application records are unchanged.

Evidence: `src/App.tsx`, `src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`, `src/hooks/useSurveyData.ts`, `src/utils/feedbackHubStore.ts`, `src/pages/PartnersFeedbackHubPage.tsx`, `.env.example`

### 2026-09-21 - Complete shared-state cutover and Realtime invalidation

Status: accepted and applied to staging

Context: Several operational stores still wrote only to browser storage, category labels could diverge between cache and remote data, empty remote sets were not always treated as authoritative, and clients did not learn about writes made by another session.

Decision: Persist all shared business/configuration/history state in typed `application_records`; retain local storage only as an authenticated cache or for device-only state. Migrate eligible legacy cache records once when the remote set is empty. Publish the two canonical application tables to Realtime and refetch through RLS on change. Consolidate RLS to one policy per operation and move security-definer authorization helpers to the unexposed `private` schema. Supply public Supabase runtime configuration through the Express `/api/config` endpoint when available.

Consequences: Staging sessions converge on Supabase values across devices, including operational histories and notification settings. An empty remote set can clear stale cache data. Realtime messages are invalidation signals rather than trusted record payloads. The two migrations preserved normalized and application record counts. The remaining Supabase security advisor item is leaked-password protection, a hosted Auth option requiring Pro or above. Production was not changed.

Evidence: `src/services/applicationRepository.ts`, `src/services/sharedStoreHydration.ts`, `src/hooks/useSurveyData.ts`, `src/App.tsx`, `server.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260921011822_centralize_shared_state.sql`, `supabase/migrations/20260921013124_consolidate_application_rls.sql`

### 2026-09-22 - Shared module back navigation

Status: accepted

Context: Detail, create, edit, and form-filling views previously inferred navigation history after rendering, so a Back action could lose its origin and fall through to Dashboard.

Decision: Route module changes through one in-memory navigation boundary in `App.tsx`. Page-level Back and Cancel controls use the same history and explicit survey-module fallback where required. Internal wizard-step controls remain local to their current module.

Consequences: Back returns users to the immediately preceding module instead of Dashboard. Navigation history is session-local and deliberately resets at login or an authorization redirect.

Evidence: `src/App.tsx`

### 2026-09-22 - Shared operational table filters

Status: accepted

Context: Operational tables used unrelated search and sort controls, and several had no alphabetical or date filtering. Document expiration is meaningful only where compliance documents exist.

Decision: Use `TableFilterBar` and the pure helpers in `tableFilters.ts` for operational listing tables. Each table exposes only fields present in its data: alphabetical and date sorting/date ranges where applicable, plus document-expiration states in Partner Companies. Document Tracker retains its more detailed field/condition/value filter builder, including document status and days-left conditions. Generated report previews, survey rating matrices, and fixed ranking-slot grids are not treated as filterable record lists.

Consequences: Table controls now share responsive styling, reset behavior, local-date range semantics, and result counts without inventing expiration filters for tables that do not contain document data.

Evidence: `src/components/TableFilterBar.tsx`, `src/utils/tableFilters.ts`, operational table consumers under `src/pages/` and `src/components/feedback-hub/`

### 2026-09-22 - Analytics ranking consistency boundary

Status: accepted

Context: Analytics ranking logic was duplicated in the page, and the best/least-performing chart always used volume weighting even when users selected Pure Average. It could therefore sort by one value while displaying another.

Decision: Keep company-ranking preparation in `src/features/analytics/domain/rankings.ts`. Every ranking consumer must pass the selected ranking mode, and charts must display the same score used for ordering. Scope calculations to the already filtered response slice and exclude all-N/A composites from ranked results.

Consequences: Champion cards, leaderboards, and best/least-performing charts consistently honor survey filters and ranking mode. Focused domain tests cover pure versus weighted ordering, displayed score selection, active survey types, and ranking direction.

Evidence: `src/features/analytics/domain/rankings.ts`, `src/features/analytics/domain/rankings.test.ts`, `src/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx`

### 2026-09-22 - Analytics presentation hierarchy

Status: accepted

Context: Analytics exposed useful information but presented overview metrics, detailed company tools, trends, and question breakdowns with similar visual weight. The ordering made the page harder to scan and left the response total and performance extremes isolated in full-width rows.

Decision: Preserve the existing analytics data and interactions while organizing the page into four presentation groups: Overview, Trends & Comparisons, Company Exploration, and Question Detail. Keep period/ranking controls in a labeled toolbar, balance the primary partner summary with response and range cards, and use responsive grids that collapse to one column without fixed-width content.

Consequences: The same analytics remain available with clearer progressive disclosure, less unused space, and more consistent control labeling. Presentation components live under `src/features/analytics/components/`; calculation ownership remains unchanged in the Analytics domain and utility layers.

Evidence: `src/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx`, `src/features/analytics/components/AnalyticsSection.tsx`, `src/features/analytics/components/AnalyticsToolbar.tsx`, `src/features/analytics/components/PerformanceHighlights.tsx`

### 2026-09-23 - Versioned active-company snapshots

Status: accepted and applied to staging on 2026-09-23

Context: Partner Companies needs an Admin-only view of the companies present in each official Courier, Supplier, and Subcontractor evaluation export. This list is distinct from the Partner Companies master-list registry and from calculated leaderboard rankings.

Decision: Store each category upload as an immutable `active_company_snapshot` application record containing its source filename, upload timestamp, actor, and deduplicated company names. Seed the first three snapshots from the repository's official Microsoft Forms CSV exports. New CSV/Excel uploads append snapshots independently per survey type; the latest timestamp is current while older snapshots remain selectable.

Consequences: Admins upload the three files from Partner Companies → Register New Partner → Upload Master List, then inspect and backtrack the lists from the Partner Companies action bar. The existing consolidated application-record RLS keeps this record type Admin-only because it is not included in any employee-readable exception. Migration `202609230001_active_company_snapshots.sql` is applied to staging; production remains unchanged and requires separate authorization.

Evidence: `src/features/active-companies/`, `src/pages/PartnerCompaniesPage.tsx`, `supabase/migrations/202609230001_active_company_snapshots.sql`

### 2026-09-23 - Frontend–Supabase semantic alignment audit

Status: structurally aligned with documented production blockers

Context: The frontend persistence paths, application-record types, Realtime invalidation, and database RLS needed one verified map after shared-state centralization and the Active Companies relocation.

Decision: Treat `docs/engineering/SUPABASE_FRONTEND_ALIGNMENT.md` as the canonical connection map. Export one runtime `APPLICATION_RECORD_TYPES` tuple and test it against the latest versioned database constraint. Refresh department permissions and active-company snapshots on their Realtime invalidation events.

Consequences: Record-type drift now fails a focused test, and those two stores converge across open clients. Three authorization gaps remain explicit production blockers: secure company-wide aggregate Analytics for lower ranks, delegated document renewal, and non-Admin archive mutations. Do not weaken raw-row RLS to solve them.

Evidence: `docs/engineering/SUPABASE_FRONTEND_ALIGNMENT.md`, `src/services/applicationRepository.ts`, `src/services/applicationRepository.test.ts`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/features/active-companies/components/ActiveCompaniesModal.tsx`

## Active modernization state

- Agent governance: established by `AGENTS.md`.
- Automated test harness: focused Feedback Hub company-report and Analytics ranking tests established; repository-wide coverage remains incomplete.
- CI/CD workflow: not established.
- Feature-module refactor: started incrementally for Feedback Hub reporting and Analytics ranking/presentation seams; large legacy pages remain.
- Backend source-of-truth migration: complete for shared state in staging; production migration/deployment still requires explicit authorization and environment-specific verification.
- Repository artifact cleanup: not started by this governance change.
